# How I Built It
### The Programming
For the backend I used Node.js as my script and connected it with my middleware utilizing Express. Through using Node.js, I was able to make Restful API Requests and parse through the data and display it through Embedded JavaScript. As for the front-end, I used HTML/CSS, and some additional Javascript. Furthermore, I created an IBM COVID-19 Watson Chatbot through which users can ask more than 70 different questions/commands regarding COVID-19 and will be responded with detailed answers. Lastly, in order to convey some helpful news, I added a feature using a news API for the latest COIVD-19 news in the state the user searches up.

### Deploying
In order to deploy my site and make it accessible for other users to use, I deployed my web app using Heroku.

# Challenges I Ran Into
One of the largest challenges I faced was connecting the EJS (Embedded Javascript) to the JavaScript file I was running off of my server. However, after a couple hours, I figured out how to correctly mainpulate the index file through sending a response from my server.

# Audience of My Web App
I envision the audience of my web app to be healthcare workers/constituents in our society who are looking to find conscise statistics regarding the COVID-19 Situation in their respective states without having to scour the internet. Instead, I believe my web app can help our society in the terms of centralizing a place for reliable data. 

# Accomplishments I am Proud Of
I was able to make this full stack web app all from scratch and without using any pre-made projects. Furthermore, I believe the simplistic yet effective UI is key in order to bring more of a larger audience.
